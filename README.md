Contributing
------------

The easiest way to contribute is to provide test cases. This can bet done in
the [Issues](https://github.com/crccheck/fuckingansible/issues). If you're more
adventerous, you can submit a pull request. Every command must be documented in
the test cases. And every new module must be mentioned in the code samples in
`index.html`.
